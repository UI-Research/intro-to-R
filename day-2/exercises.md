# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Create a scatter plot with the `storms` data set with category on the x-axis and wind on the y-axis. 

## Exercise 2

`geom_jitter()` is like `geom_point()` but it adds random noise to points so overlappering points are easier to distinguish. Replace `geom_point()` with `geom_jitter()` in your previous example. 

## Exercise 3

Add `height = 0` and `alpha = 0.2` inside `geom_jitter()` from your previous example. What do these arguments do?

## Exercise 4

What is the difference between  `geom_bar()` and `geom_col()`? Build an example with each geom.
