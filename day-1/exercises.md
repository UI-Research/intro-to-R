# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Calculate `1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 5` by submitting the code in the console. Now, create a .R script, add the code, and calculate the answer by submitting the code from the script. 

## Exercise 2

Assign the value of `1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 5` to your name. Add a comment explaining the calculation.

## Exercise 3

Look up the function `mean()` with `?`. What arguments does mean have?

## Exercise 4

Install `tidyverse`. Load `tidyverse`.

## Exercise 5

`storms` is a data set from `library(dplyr)` which is loaded by `library(tidyverse)`. Submit `storms` in the console to see the `tibble`. Submit `View(storms)` to see the `tibble` as a window. Use `glimpse(storms)` to see a summary of `storms`. Assign `storms` to a name with `<-` so it shows up in the global environment. 

## Exercise 6

Capitalize `name` in the `storms` data set and assign it to a new data set with just `Name`, `year`, `month`, and `day`.

## Exercise 7

Find any storms that were active on June 20th. 

## Exercise 8

`wind` is measured in knots. Convert `wind` into miles per hour. Each knot is equal to 1.15078 miles per hour.
