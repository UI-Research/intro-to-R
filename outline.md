# Day 1

## The Owl
Statistical programming, data visualization, and public policy analysis are difficult. Four hours isn't enough to master R. The goal of this training is to offer hands-on experience and enough comfort that beginners can ask the right question when hitting his or her first wall. 

## Why R?
* Free!
* Open source
* Powerful and extensible

## How do I turn this thing on?
* Difference between R and RStudio
* R is a calculator
  * Submit code at the console
  * Submit code from scripts

## Basic syntax
* `<-` is the assignment operator
* `#` begins a comment
* `?` searches for functions and data sets. Drop the parentheses!
* `%>%` is the pipe operator
* `c()` is concatenate

## Functions
* R is based on functions of the form `mean()`. R has powerful tools for creating custom functions. 

## R packages
* `install.packages("tidyverse")`
* `library(tidyverse)`
* R has powerful tools for creating custom packages. 

## Rectangles
* `tidyverse`
* The idea is to only use one data structure, and a host of functions that are specialized to that data structure.

## View()

## `library(dplyr)`
* Seven-point-five functions:
  1. `select()`
  2. `rename()`
  3. `filter()`
  4. `arrange()` and `desc()`
  5. `mutate()`
  6. `summarize()`
  7. `group_by()`
